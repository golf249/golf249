# üëã Hello! I'm Jirapat Rojnuckarin (Golf)

Welcome to my GitHub! I am a final year engineering student currently pursuing a degree in MEng Aeronautical with Spacecraft Engineering with a strong focus on engineering applications, machine learning, and control systems. My interests lie at the intersection of technology and problem-solving, and I am eager to contribute to innovative projects that impact the world.

## üîß **What I'm Working On**:
- Neural Networks & Machine Learning: I‚Äôve been learning and experimenting with deep learning, specifically in Convolution Neural Network and its promising application in the field of computer vision. I'm extremely excited by how AI can be applied to engineering challenges and I am planning to create a project which combines the two disciplines together!

- Finite Element Analysis: I‚Äôm proficient in using Abaqus/CAE for simulations and analysis of complex static and dynamic problems.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Skills & Tools**:
- **Programming Languages**: Python, MATLAB, C++

- **Engineering Software**: Abaqus/CAE, SolidWorks, AutoCAD

- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Scikit-learn

- **Control Systems**: Simulink, PID control, LQR control, Kalman filtering, Optimisation

- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub

## üí° **Projects & Contributions**:
I love working on projects that challenge my problem-solving skills and push me to learn new technologies. Some of the projects I‚Äôve worked on include:

- **Europa Landing Simulation**: This project focuses on simulating the landing of a spacecraft on Europa, including challenges like low gravity, icy terrain, and uncertain surface conditions. I designed a control systems in MATLAB using the principal of the 'Lossless Convexification' for finding the optimal path to the specified landing location. The project includes:
  - Descent Control: Simulating descent with real-time adjustment of main thrusters and reaction control system to minimise fuel consumption and landing errors.
  - Hazard Detection: Exploring sensor-based systems to detect surface irregularities or ice fractures during landing.

- **Project Svarog**: To construct a craft that will reach the Sun‚Äôs escape velocity and the heliopause (assumed at 123 AU from the Sun) within 100 years from launch by using solar sail technology.
  - Currently working as an mechanical and structural simulation engineer to ensure the structural integrity of the sail's hub during the main demonstration at Esrange, Kiruna, as part of the BEXUS programme.
